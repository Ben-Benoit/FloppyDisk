### Instructions:
>
	- When countdown timer hits 0, game will start.
    - You must rapidly press the spacebar to make the player jump in the air.
	- Walls will rapidly approach the player from the right side of the screen.
	- You must get the player to pass through the space between the top and bottom walls.
	- Game will continue forever until the player collides with a wall (or touches a lethal ceiling or floor on harder difficulties).
	- Score will increase by 1 point each time a wall reaches the left side of the screen.
    - Score will reset each time a difficulty is selected. (Score is not saved, so just remember what your high score was!)
>

### To-Do:
>
	- Add a welcome screen. (Right now, the game just starts on page load).
	- Add a main menu with instructions, volume settings, and keyboard mapping screen.
	- Add high-score saving/tracking.
>

### Possible high-score implementations:
>
	- Could use browser cookies to keep track of individual players scores across sessions.
	- Could use a database to link IP Addresses to player scores to enable global scoreboard.
	- Could add a login system, and use a database to link usernames to high scores.
